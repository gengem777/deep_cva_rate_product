# deep_cva_rate_product
We adapt the algorithm in Deep-Xva Solver to test the interest swap CVA ($CVA_{IRS}$). We find that IRS CVA can be decomposed into summation of several $\overline{CVA}_{[t, T_{1}]}^{T_{2}}-$type IRS CVA with terminal payoff after the end of default time interval. We explore the $CVA_{IRS}$ with default time period between the start time and the expiration time (first swap time). In the first section, we review the theoretical part of general xVA BSDE and introduce the derivation of them. In the second section, we introduce the interest swap CVA and justify the $\overline{CVA}_{[t, T_{1}]}^{T_{2}}-$type IRS CVA we need to explore and make the connection between the first part and second part. The third section is the algorithm design: we do the time discretization and simulation. The last section is the implementation and comparison. In our implementation, for the simplicity, we just evaluate one time interest swap (Forward Rate Agreement).
